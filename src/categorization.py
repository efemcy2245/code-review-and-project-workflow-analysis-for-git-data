    You are tasked with categorizing commits based on their purpose and significance. Use the following categories:

    {categories_text}

    Each commit has the following details:
    - **Commit Informations:**
      - **Hash (unique identifier):** {commit['hash']}
      - **Author:** {commit['author']}
      - **Date:** {commit['date'].strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')}
      - **Commit Message:** {commit['message']}
      - **Changed Files:** {', '.join(commit['files'])}
      - **Diffs:** The following are the lines of code changed in each file:
        {chr(10).join([f"{file_name}: {diff[:1000]}" for file_name, diff in commit['diffs'].items()])}

    **Instructions:**
    1. Review the commit information carefully, including the message, modified files, and code diffs.
    2. Classify the commit into one of the provided categories.
    3. Provide a single category from the list based on the purpose and significance of the changes.
